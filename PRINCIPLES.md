At the time of writing this, I was 27 years old. People tend to have a characteristic stance usually until this age. So, this document contains some of my characteristic stances that I call "Principles" or "My Principles". This may be updated in the future.

## Verbosity is a virtue and the comprehension is in the mind of the beholder.

This principle formed in my mind as I was dealing with loggers while programming. So it is based on logging. Logging has layers and filters and the developers filter and classify them to their requirements and sense.

Basically, one needs to form their sentences in a way:

 - that aims to not have further interpretations
 - that aims to not raise further questions

In order to achieve these, the safest way is to provide information (about a problem or event) in enough quantities. This "enough", most of the time, means "higher" because people tend not to provide enough information in a social context, which leads further interpretations and questions, thus the loss of time and effort.

<!-- TODO a better example -->

Consider this concrete laboratory example: You are an English teacher in an English course and your students demanded to change the schedule of your class. So, you go to your education coordinator and tell:

 > The students want to change the hours of class. They said they are not okay with it.

While this is okay in a social context, this might also have **further interpretations** on education coordinator's side:

 - "Maybe this teacher is not cut for this class because he frequently comes with demands from students."
 - "These students are just spoiled."
 - "They have agreed on time before the course. If they were not available, maybe I should contact them and ask them to join to another available hours and days."

This might also have the education coordinator to ask **further questions** such as:

 - "Why do they want to change?"
 - "Which days/hours do they want?"
 - "Which class code are you talking about?"
 - "Who wants to change?"

"Verbosity is a virtue." principle comes into play in this situation. Instead of forming your sentence as above, you can form it as:

 > The students of 123B1 (class code and level code) on Thursday from 7 to 10 want to change the hours of class. Many of them are working until late hours and some of them have a problem with commuting. I think it is a reasonable demand.

...which would greatly eliminate further interpretations and questions on the said event.

To some, that might sound quite robotic and hard to follow, thus the second part of this principle is "The comprehension is in the mind of beholder.". You have completed your responsibility to clearly state the nature of the problem, you have done your job (almost) perfectly. So, it is also receiver's responsibility to filter and classify what you have presented.

# Stability is the true moral.
